# tprof

tprof is a distributed systems performance profiler powered by the core ideas of structural aggregation and automated analysis of distributed systems traces.

## How to run
Requirement: Ubuntu 20.04 with UI

```
./start.sh
```

This script should take care of installing all the required packages and running through the process (a.k.a. push-button) to generate demo bug reports looking like this:
