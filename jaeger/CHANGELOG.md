1.15.1 (2019-11-07)
------------------

##### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements

* Build platform binaries as part of CI ([#1909](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1909), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))
* Upgrade and fix dependencies ([#1907](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1907), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))


1.15.0 (2019-11-07)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Breaking Changes

* The default value for the Ingester's flag `ingester.deadlockInterval` has been changed to `0` ([#1868](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1868), [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling))

  With the new default, the ingester won't `panic` if there are no messages for the last minute. To restore the previous behavior, set the flag's value to `1m`.

* Mark `--collector.grpc.tls.client.ca` flag as deprecated for jaeger-collector. ([#1840](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1840), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))

  The deprecated flag will still work until being removed, it's recommended to use `--collector.grpc.tls.client-ca` instead.

##### New Features

* Support TLS for Kafka ([#1414](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1414), [@MichaHoffmann](https://github.com/MichaHoffmann))

* Handling of expected error codes coming from grpc storage plugins #1741 ([#1814](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1814), [@chandresh-pancholi](https://github.com/chandresh-pancholi))
* Fix ordering of indexScanKeys after TraceID parsing ([#1809](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1809), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Small memory optimizations in badger write-path ([#1771](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1771), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Set an empty value when a default env var value is missing ([#1777](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1777), [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling))
* Decouple storage dependencies and bump Go to 1.13.x ([#1886](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1886), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))
* Update gopkg.in/yaml.v2 dependency to v2.2.4 ([#1865](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1865), [@objectiser](https://github.com/objectiser))

* Unpin grpc version and use serviceConfig to set the load balancer  ([#1786](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1786), [@guanw](https://github.com/guanw))

#### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.5.0. The changelog is available here [v1.5.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v150-november-4-2019)

1.14.0 (2019-09-02)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Breaking Changes

* Create ES index templates instead of indices ([#1627](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1627), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

  This can break existing Elasticsearch deployments if security policies are applied.
  For instance Jaeger `X-Pack` configuration now requires permission to create index templates - `manage_index_templates`.

##### New Features

* Add Elasticsearch version configuration to rollover script ([#1769](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1769), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Add Elasticsearch version flag ([#1753](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1753), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Add Elasticsearch 7 support ([#1690](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1690), [@gregoryfranklin](https://github.com/gregoryfranklin))

  The index mappings in Elasticsearch 7 are not backwards compatible with the older versions.
  Therefore using Elasticsearch 7 with data created with older version would not work.
  Elasticsearch 6.8 supports 7.x, 6.x, 5.x compatible mappings. The upgrade has to be done
  first to ES 6.8, then apply data migration or wait until old daily indices are removed (this requires
  to start Jaeger with `--es.version=7` to force using ES 7.x mappings for newly created indices).

  Jaeger by default uses Elasticsearch ping endpoint (`/`) to derive the version which is used
  for index mappings selection. The version can be overridden by flag `--es.version`.

* Support for Zipkin Protobuf spans over HTTP ([#1695](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1695), [@jan25](https://github.com/jan25))
* Added support for hot reload of UI config ([#1688](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1688), [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling))
* Added base Grafana dashboard and Alert rules ([#1745](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1745), [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling))
* Add the jaeger-mixin for monitoring ([#1668](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1668), [@gouthamve](https://github.com/gouthamve))
* Added flags for driving cassandra connection compression through config ([#1675](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1675), [@sagaranand015](https://github.com/sagaranand015))
* Support index cleaner for rollover indices and add integration tests ([#1689](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1689), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Add client TLS auth to gRPC reporter ([#1591](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1591), [@tcolgate](https://github.com/tcolgate))
* Collector kafka producer protocol version config ([#1658](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1658), [@marqc](https://github.com/marqc))
* Configurable kafka protocol version for msg consuming by jaeger ingester ([#1640](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1640), [@marqc](https://github.com/marqc))
* Use credentials when describing keyspaces in cassandra schema builder ([#1655](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1655), [@MiLk](https://github.com/MiLk))
* Add connect-timeout for Cassandra ([#1647](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1647), [@sagaranand015](https://github.com/sagaranand015))

##### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements

* Add CA certificates to agent image ([#1764](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1764), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))
* Fix badger merge-join algorithm to correctly filter indexes ([#1721](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1721), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Change Zipkin CORS origins and headers to comma separated list ([#1556](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1556), [@JonasVerhofste](https://github.com/JonasVerhofste))
* Added null guards to 'Process' when processing an incoming span ([#1723](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1723), [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling))
* Export expvar metrics of badger to the metricsFactory ([#1704](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1704), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Pass TTL as int, not as float64 ([#1710](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1710), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))
* Use find by regex for archive index in index cleaner ([#1693](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1693), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Allow token propagation if token type is not specified ([#1685](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1685), [@rubenvp8510](https://github.com/rubenvp8510))
* Fix duplicated spans when querying Elasticsearch ([#1677](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1677), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Fix the threshold precision issue ([#1665](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1665), [@guanw](https://github.com/guanw))
* Badger filter duplicate results from a single indexSeek ([#1649](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1649), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Badger make default dirs work in Windows ([#1653](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1653), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))

#### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.4.0. The changelog is available here [v1.4.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v130-june-21-2019)

1.13.1 (2019-06-28)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Breaking Changes

##### New Features

##### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements

* Change default for bearer-token-propagation to false ([#1642](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1642), [@wsoula](https://github.com/wsoula))

#### UI Changes

1.13.0 (2019-06-27)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Breaking Changes

* The traces related metrics on collector now have a new tag `sampler_type` ([#1576](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1576), [@guanw](https://github.com/guanw))

  This might break some existing metrics dashboard (if so, users need to update query to aggregate over this new tag).

  The list of metrics affected: `traces.received`, `traces.rejected`, `traces.saved-by-svc`.

* Remove deprecated index prefix separator `:` from Elastic ([#1620](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1620), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

  In Jaeger 1.9.0 release the Elasticsearch index separator was changed from `:` to `-`. To keep backwards
  compatibility the query service kept querying indices with `:` separator, however the new indices
  were created only with `-`. This release of Jaeger removes the query capability for indices containing `:`,
  therefore it's recommended to keep using older version until indices containing old separator are
  not queried anymore.

##### New Features

* Passthrough OAuth bearer token supplied to Query service through to ES storage ([#1599](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1599), [@rubenvp8510](https://github.com/rubenvp8510))
* Kafka kerberos authentication support for collector/ingester ([#1589](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1589), [@rubenvp8510](https://github.com/rubenvp8510))
* Allow Cassandra schema builder to use credentials ([#1635](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1635), [@PS-EGHornbostel](https://github.com/PS-EGHornbostel))
* Add docs generation command ([#1572](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1572), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

##### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements

* Use json number when unmarshalling data from ES ([#1618](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1618), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Define logs as nested data type ([#1622](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1622), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Fix archive storage not querying old spans older than maxSpanAge ([#1617](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1617), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Query service: fix logging errors on SIGINT ([#1601](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1601), [@jan25](https://github.com/jan25))
* Direct grpc logs to Zap logger ([#1606](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1606), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))
* Fix sending status to health check channel in Query service ([#1598](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1598), [@jan25](https://github.com/jan25))
* Add tmp-volume to all-in-one image to fix badger storage ([#1571](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1571), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Do not fail es-cleaner if there are no jaeger indices ([#1569](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1569), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
* Automatically set `GOMAXPROCS` ([#1560](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1560), [@rubenvp8510](https://github.com/rubenvp8510))
* Add CA certs to all-in-one image ([#1554](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1554), [@chandresh-pancholi](https://github.com/chandresh-pancholi))

#### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.3.0. The changelog is available here [v1.3.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v130-june-21-2019)

1.12.0 (2019-05-16)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Breaking Changes
- The `kafka` flags were removed in favor of `kafka.producer` and `kafka.consumer` flags ([#1424](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1424), [@ledor473](https://github.com/ledor473))

    The following flags have been **removed** in the Collector and the Ingester:
    ```
    --kafka.brokers
    --kafka.encoding
    --kafka.topic
    --ingester.brokers
    --ingester.encoding
    --ingester.topic
    --ingester.group-id
    ```

    In the Collector, they are replaced by:
    ```
    --kafka.producer.brokers
    --kafka.producer.encoding
    --kafka.producer.topic
    ```

    In the Ingester, they are replaced by:
    ```
    --kafka.consumer.brokers
    --kafka.consumer.encoding
    --kafka.consumer.topic
    --kafka.consumer.group-id
    ```

* Add Admin port and group all ports in one file ([#1442](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1442), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))

    This change fixes issues [#1428](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1428), [#1332](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1332) and moves all metrics endpoints from API ports to **admin ports**. It requires re-configuring Prometheus scraping rules. Each Jaeger binary has its own admin port that can be found under `--admin-http-port` command line flag by running the `${binary} help` command.

##### New Features

* Add inbound transport as label to collector metrics [#1446](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1446) ([guanw](https://github.com/guanw))
* Sorted key/value store `badger` backed storage plugin ([#760](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/760), [@burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm))
* Add Admin port and group all ports in one file ([#1442](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1442), [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))
* Adds support for agent level tag ([#1396](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1396), [@annanay25](https://github.com/annanay25))

* Switch from counter to a gauge for partitions held ([#1485](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1485), [@bobrik](https://github.com/bobrik))
* Add CORS handling for Zipkin collector service ([#1463](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1463), [@JonasVerhofste](https://github.com/JonasVerhofste))
* Check elasticsearch nil response ([#1467](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1467), [@YEXINGZHE54](https://github.com/YEXINGZHE54))
* Disable sampling in logger - `zap`([#1460](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1460), [@psinghal20](https://github.com/psinghal20))
* New layout for proto definitions and generated files ([#1427](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1427), [@annanay25](https://github.com/annanay25))
* Upgrade Go to 1.12.1 ([#1437](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1437) ,[@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro))

#### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.2.0. The changelog is available here [v1.2.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v120-may-14-2019)

    The following flags have been deprecated in the Collector and the Ingester:
    ```
    --kafka.brokers
    --kafka.encoding

    ```

    In the Collector, they are replaced by:

- Use `CQLSH_HOST` in final call to `cqlsh` ([#1372](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1372), [@funny-falcon](https://github.com/funny-falcon))

#### UI Changes

* UI pinned to version 1.1.0. The changelog is available here [v1.1.0](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v110-march-3-2019)


1.10.1 (2019-02-21)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

- Discover dependencies table version automatically ([#1364](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1364), [@black-adder](https://github.com/black-adder))

##### Breaking Changes

##### New Features

##### Bug fixes, Minor Improvements

- Separate query-service functionality from http handler ([#1312](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1312), [@annanay25](https://github.com/annanay25))

#### UI Changes


1.10.0 (2019-02-15)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Breaking Changes

- Remove cassandra SASI indices ([#1328](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1328), [@black-adder](https://github.com/black-adder))

Migration Path:

1. Run `plugin/storage/cassandra/schema/migration/v001tov002part1.sh` which will copy dependencies into a csv, update the `dependency UDT`, create a new `dependencies_v2` table, and write dependencies from the csv into the `dependencies_v2` table.
2. Run the collector and query services with the cassandra flag `cassandra.enable-dependencies-v2=true` which will instruct jaeger to write and read to and from the new `dependencies_v2` table.
3. Update [spark job](https://github.com/jaegertracing/spark-dependencies) to write to the new `dependencies_v2` table. The feature will be done in [#58](https://github.com/jaegertracing/spark-dependencies/issues/58).
4. Run `plugin/storage/cassandra/schema/migration/v001tov002part2.sh` which will DELETE the old dependency table and the SASI index.

Users who wish to continue to use the v1 table don't have to do anything as the cassandra flag `cassandra.enable-dependencies-v2` will default to false. Users may migrate on their own timeline however new features will be built solely on the `dependencies_v2` table. In the future, we will remove support for v1 completely.

- Remove `ErrorBusy`, it essentially duplicates `SpansDropped` ([#1091](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1091), [@cstyan](https://github.com/cstyan))

##### New Features

- Support certificates in elasticsearch scripts ([#1339](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1399), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
- Add ES Rollover support to main indices ([#1309](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1309), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
- Load ES auth token from file ([#1319](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1319), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))
- Add username/password authentication to ES index cleaner ([#1318](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1318), [@gregoryfranklin](https://github.com/gregoryfranklin))
- Add implementation of FindTraceIDs function for Elasticsearch reader ([#1280](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1280), [@vlamug](https://github.com/vlamug))
- Support archive traces for ES storage ([#1197](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1197), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

#### UI Changes


1.9.0 (2019-01-21)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Breaking Changes

- Change Elasticsearch index prefix from `:` to `-` ([#1284](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1284), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

Changed index prefix separator from `:`  to `-` because Elasticsearch 7 does not allow `:` in index name.
Jaeger query still reads from old indices containing `-` as a separator, therefore no configuration or migration changes are required.



- Add CLI configurable `es.max-num-spans` while retrieving spans from ES ([#1283](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1283), [@annanay25](https://github.com/annanay25))

The default value is set to 10000. Before no limit was applied.


- Update to jaeger-lib 2 and latest sha for jaeger-client-go, to pick up refactored metric names ([#1282](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1282), [@objectiser](https://github.com/objectiser))

Update to latest version of `jaeger-lib`, which includes a change to the naming of counters exported to
prometheus, to follow the convention of using a `_total` suffix, e.g. `jaeger_query_requests` is now
`jaeger_query_requests_total`.

Jaeger go client metrics, previously under the namespace `jaeger_client_jaeger_` are now under
`jaeger_tracer_`.


- Add gRPC metrics to agent ([#1180](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1180), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

The following metrics:
```
jaeger_agent_tchannel_reporter_batch_size{format="jaeger"} 0
jaeger_agent_tchannel_reporter_batch_size{format="zipkin"} 0
jaeger_agent_tchannel_reporter_batches_failures{format="jaeger"} 0

jaeger_agent_collector_proxy{endpoint="sampling",result="err"} 0
jaeger_agent_collector_proxy{endpoint="sampling",result="ok"} 0
```
have been renamed to:
```
jaeger_agent_reporter_batch_size{format="jaeger",protocol="tchannel"} 0
jaeger_agent_reporter_batch_size{format="zipkin",protocol="tchannel"} 0
jaeger_agent_reporter_batches_failures{format="jaeger",protocol="tchannel"} 0

jaeger_agent_reporter_spans_failures{format="jaeger",protocol="tchannel"} 0
jaeger_agent_reporter_spans_failures{format="zipkin",protocol="tchannel"} 0
jaeger_agent_reporter_spans_submitted{format="jaeger",protocol="tchannel"} 0
jaeger_agent_reporter_spans_submitted{format="zipkin",protocol="tchannel"} 0

jaeger_agent_collector_proxy{endpoint="baggage",protocol="tchannel",result="err"} 0
jaeger_agent_collector_proxy{endpoint="baggage",protocol="tchannel",result="ok"} 0
jaeger_agent_collector_proxy{endpoint="sampling",protocol="tchannel",result="err"} 0
jaeger_agent_collector_proxy{endpoint="sampling",protocol="tchannel",result="ok"} 0
```

- Rename tcollector proxy metric in agent ([#1182](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1182), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

The following metric:
```
jaeger_http_server_errors{source="tcollector-proxy",status="5xx"}
```
has been renamed to:
```
jaeger_http_server_errors{source="collector-proxy",status="5xx"}

1.8.0 (2018-11-12)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Breaking Changes

- Refactor agent configuration ([#1092](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1092), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

The following agent flags has been deprecated in order to support multiple reporters:
```bash
--collector.host-port
--discovery.conn-check-timeout
--discovery.min-peers
```
New flags:
```bash
--reporter.tchannel.host-port
--reporter.tchannel.discovery.conn-check-timeout
--reporter.tchannel.discovery.min-peers
```

- Various changes around metrics produced by jaeger-query: Names scoped to the query component, generated for all span readers (not just ES), consolidate query metrics and include result tag ([#1074](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1074), [#1075](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1075) and [#1096](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1096), [@objectiser](https://github.com/objectiser))

For example, sample of metrics produced for `find_traces` operation before:

```
jaeger_find_traces_attempts 1
jaeger_find_traces_errLatency_bucket{le="0.005"} 0
jaeger_find_traces_errors 0
jaeger_find_traces_okLatency_bucket{le="0.005"} 0
jaeger_find_traces_responses_bucket{le="0.005"} 1
jaeger_find_traces_successes 1
```

And now:

```
jaeger_query_latency_bucket{operation="find_traces",result="err",le="0.005"} 0
jaeger_query_latency_bucket{operation="find_traces",result="ok",le="0.005"} 2
jaeger_query_requests{operation="find_traces",result="err"} 0
jaeger_query_requests{operation="find_traces",result="ok"} 2
jaeger_query_responses_bucket{operation="find_traces",le="0.005"} 2
```
